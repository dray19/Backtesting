# Backtesting
This is an example of code from of my GA back testing model.

“Class_GA.py” is a python class that has all of the code that we used to run our test. We created this file because we wanted to do some different back testing than what other python libraries can do. This python class was imported in to the file “model_run1.ipynb”.

“model_run1.ipynb” is the running of code in “Class_GA.py”. The code imported in to Github was used to test to see if “Class_GA.py” was what we wanted. I used “plotly” to create the plots, which means that they cannot be seen on GitHub.  Also, some of the “raw_return” function runs on a loop and asks if we want to reallocate or change our position every 6 months. It also gives the option to clear data in the kernel, that is why, we can only see the final results. 

“data_for_test.csv” is some of the data that we used for testing of our research theories.
